# Sokoban

Sokoban (倉庫番 sōko-ban, "warehouse keeper") is a type of 
puzzle video game, in which the player pushes boxes or crates 
around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations.

Sokoban was created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and 
published in December 1982 by Thinking Rabbit, a software 
house based in Takarazuka, Japan.

## Rules
The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a 
floor or a wall. Some floor squares contain boxes, and some 
floor squares are marked as storage locations.

The player is confined to the board, and may move horizontally or 
vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). 
The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the 
square beyond. Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, 
and they cannot be pulled. The number of boxes is equal to the 
number of storage locations. The puzzle is solved when all boxes 
are at storage locations.
